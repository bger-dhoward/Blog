# About This.
This is a web log for me to document some of my work doing computational design. You're currently in the GitHub repo for the site, which is hosted by GitHub Pages as [Frontier of Ignorance](https://bger-dhoward.github.io/Frontier-of-Ignorance/)

#### Why Github Pages?
Basically, because I'm enjoying using Git and Github, and [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) is actually really easy to work with. I learned how to set this page up at the [GitHub Skills: Github Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)
