## A short listing of projects:
- Graphic Program Generator - pyRevit
  - Initial Healthcare version - reads from CSV format used by our healthcare planners, converts to simple 2D Revit filled regions.
  - Aggregate version for University client - uses same CSV format, but with some nomenclature changes for client.  Used to visualize existing facilites
  - Existing Room-by-Room - for University client, placing each existing room (of varying size) on same line, with row wrapping
  - 3D Healthcare version - Uses 3D generic model family in Revit, with built in clustering. 
- Experimental Project Data website - Python, Flask, SQLite
  - Processes exported Deltek data into a SQLite database to track updates to project forecasts
  - Lists projects to locally hosted Flask website, with custom visuals to show week-by-week project forcast hours per phase.
  - Allows for data fields to be added to each project, edited, and displayed all in browser.

## There's some other stuff too, but this is just a start.
