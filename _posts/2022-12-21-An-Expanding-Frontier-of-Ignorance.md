> There is an expanding frontier of ignorance [^1]
<sub>Richard Feynman - Six Easy Pieces</sub>


This is just a quick draft of a blog post to follow the tutorial.



[^1]: I'll have to go back and look for the context of this quote, but from what I remember, I noted it because it speaks to how, with every new subject we come in contact with, the amount of things that we know that we don't know is always expanding. I'm learning new things, and going to try to use this bloggy thing to help organize, document, and share what I'm working on and learning.
